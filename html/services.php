                <h1>Services</h1>
                <br />
                Whether your project involves Audio Services for
                film, video games, TV, radio or any other form of
                media, look no further for great audio. I will
                provide a finished audio product ready for
                integration. Deliverables can be audio files in any
                format, DAW session (Pro Tools, logic, DP) or
                middleware project files (Fmod and Wwise).<br />
                <br />

                <h2>Sound Design</h2>
                <br />
                Custom effects edited and spotted to the precise
                location for maximum impact. Extensive effect
                libraries augmented by foley and morphing provide
                the foundation for adding excitement, emotion, and
                depth.<br />
                <br />

                <h2>Music Composition</h2>
                <br />
                Original music and ambience that is fresh and
                engaging. Along with effects, an effective musical
                score will help tell your story and get your point
                across.<br />
                <br />

                <h2>Voice Over / ADR</h2>
                <br />
                Dialogue tracking, editing and replacement.  Superb
                microphones and gear make it easy to achieve a
                clean synchronized dialogue track.<br />
                <br />

                <h2>Audio Sweetening</h2>
                <br />
                Whether it is salvaging poor audio or just putting
                on the finishing touches, I can get your audio
                sounding great, fast. The right tools and expertise
                will optimize your project&rsquo;s audio quality
                and give it that professional sheen everyone
                expects.<br />

                <div class="divider"></div>
				<h1>Pricing</h1>
                <br />
                Rates vary between $30-$40/hr depending upon
                project size and scope. Drop me a line with some
                details about the needs of your project and I will
                email a quote.<br />
                <br />

                <h2>Request a quote</h2>
                <br />
                If you would like to get a quote on your project,
                send an email with as many details as possible
                about the type of work you are looking for. The
                scope, timeline, delivery format and stylistic
                notes would be most helpful.  I will probably have
                a few more questions, but we can at least begin to
                determine exactly what you need and the most
                effective delivery vehicle.<br />
                <br />
                Once I begin to understand the project vision, I
                will create some samples for you to review before
                the work begins.<br />
